# Gelation-Cloning-Control
This program allows for manual and automated control of a laser-microscope system integrated with a Laser and Camera system. Written for cell experiments using lasers

## Hardware involved:

Laser Module:   Arroyo 4308 LaserSource
Camera:         Basler pia2400-17gm
Microscope:     Nikon Eclipse TI

*The program is specifically written for the laser and camera module above. Can be adapted to other systems but unfortunately I do not have the resources or time to implement and test a large amount of cameras and laser modules*

## Software and Libraries used:
EmguCV (OpenCV C# Wrapper)
FIJI ImageJ

## Install notes:
Install Basler Pylon software & driver installed (otherwise will experience runtime SEHException error when running program): https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/software/original-software/
